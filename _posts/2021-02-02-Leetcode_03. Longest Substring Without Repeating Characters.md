# [알고리즘] Leetcode_3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Definition

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

 > Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Example 1:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 > Output: 3
 > Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 2:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: s = "bbbbb"
 > Output: 1
 > Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 3:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: s = "pwwkew"
 > Output: 3
 > Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 > Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 4:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: s = ""
 > Output: 0
 > ```
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Constraints:**
 >
 > - `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
 > - `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Initial Solution : $$O(n^3)$$

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubstringFromHead(self, s):
        observed_char = []
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in observed_char:
                return i
            else:
                observed_char.append(s[i])
        return len(s)
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        max_length = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            temp = self.longestSubstringFromHead(s[i:])
            if temp > max_length:
                max_length = temp
        return max_length
```

Used brute force method to solve the problem. we find the longest substring without repeating characters  from s[0:] to s[-1]. The run time is within accepted range, However, it needs optimization. 

Time complexity is O(n^3) because ```if s[i] in observed_char:```  has a time complexity of O(n).
