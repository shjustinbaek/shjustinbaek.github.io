# [알고리즘] Leetcode_21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Problem Definition

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

 > Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Example 1:**

 >
 > ```
 > Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
 > Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 2:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
 > Output: []
 > ```

## Initial Solution : $$O(n)$$

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        node1 = l1
        node2 = l2
        rtn = ListNode(0)
        head = rtn
        while node1 and node2:
            if node1.val <= node2.val:
                rtn.next = node1
                node1 = node1.next
            else:
                rtn.next = node2
                node2 = node2.next
            rtn = rtn.next
        if node1:
            rtn.next = node1
        else:
            rtn.next = node2
        return head.next
```

While loop:

- Since both LinkedLists are sorted, compare value from head of each linked list. append smaller value to a new linked list.

After while loop:

- the end of while loop indicates that one of two linkedlists is exhausted. append the remaining linkedlist to merged linkedlist.
