# [알고리즘] Leetcode_11. Container With Most Water

## Problem Definition

https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

 > Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 >
 > **Notice** that you may not slant the container.

 > ```
 > Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 > Output: 49
 > Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 > ```
 > Input: height = [1,1]
 > Output: 1
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 3:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
 > Output: 16
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 4:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: height = [1,2,1]
 > Output: 2
 > ```
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Constraints:**
 >
 > - `n == height.length`
 > - `2 <= n <= 3 * 104`
 > - `0 <= height[i] <= 3 * 104`



## Initial Solution : $$O(n)$$

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0 
        j = len(height) - 1
        rtn = 0
        
        while i < j:
            area = min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i)
            if area > rtn:
                rtn = area
            
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        
        return rtn
```

Key idea: area = width * min(height1, height2)

width is maximized when using 0th and last element 

Thus, we do not have to compute all possible combinations

-> start from outside move in -> guarantees we can find max value in
