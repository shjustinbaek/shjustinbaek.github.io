## Problem Definition

https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

 > Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrome integer.
 >
 > An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, `121` is palindrome while `123` is not.
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Example 1:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: x = 121
 > Output: true
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 2:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: x = -121
 > Output: false
 > Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 3:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: x = 10
 > Output: false
 > Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 4:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: x = -101
 > Output: false
 > ```

## Initial Solution : $$O(1)$$

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if len(str(x)) == 1:
            return True
        half_length = len(str(x))//2
        #does not work when len(str(x)) == 1
        first_half = str(x)[:half_length]
        last_half = str(x)[-half_length:] 
   
        if first_half == last_half[::-1]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Things I learned from this solution:

- using floored_division(//) to select first and last half of str works when len(str) is larger than 1. However, this approach faces problems when length of str is 1. str[:0] returns null. This case must be treated as an exception. 

## Improved Solution1 : $$O(1)$$

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        temp = str(x)
        if temp == temp[::-1]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

surprisingly, this is slower than the first solution. (Not sure why...) 

([::-1] operation's time complexity is O(n) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45330006/what-is-the-time-complexity-and-space-complexity-of-array-1) 

However, this approach, that checks the literal definition of palindrome, is a much simpler solution to the problem.

(?) What is this algorithm's time complexity? 

If we assume n = # digits of input. Then, the time complexity is O(n). But n is  the input integer....

## Improved Solution2 : $$O(1)$$

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        temp = x
        reverse_num = 0
        while temp > 0:
            last_digit = temp%10
            reverse_num = reverse_num*10 + last_digit
            temp = temp//10
        if x == reverse_num:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

1. Use Mod operator to extract last digit of x
2. save it in reverse_num (*10 to preserve previous last digit)
3. get rid saved last digit by //10.
