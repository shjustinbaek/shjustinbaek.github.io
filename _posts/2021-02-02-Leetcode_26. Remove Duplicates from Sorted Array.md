# [알고리즘] Leetcode_26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Problem Definition

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

 > Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appears only *once* and returns the new length.
 >
 > Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.
 >
 > **Clarification:**
 >
 > Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
 >
 > Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
 >
 > Internally you can think of this:
 >
 > ```
 > // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
 > int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
 > 
 > // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
 > // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
 > for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
 >     print(nums[i]);
 > }
 > ```
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Example 1:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 > Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
 > Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 2:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
 > Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
 > Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

## Initial Solution : $$O(n)$$

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mapping = {}
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] in mapping:
                nums.pop(i)
            else:
                mapping[nums[i]] = None
                i += 1
        return len(nums)
```

Used dictionary to keep track of what number has occurred.

However, it did not exploit the fact that the list if sorted.

## Improved Solution1 : $$O(n)$$

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 1
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                nums.pop(i)
            else:
                i += 1
        return len(nums)
```

Used the fact that the list is sorted:

if an element is the same as the previous element, it is a duplicated element -> remove. 

else: read next element

This solution is slightly faster than the previous solution. ranking went up about 10%.

## :exclamation:Improved Solution2 : $$O(nlog(n))$$:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        #[:] in order not to create a new list
        nums[:] = sorted(set(nums))
        return len(nums)
```

Apparently, python set() method has a time complexity of O(1)

and sorted () method has a time complexity of O(nlog(n))

I am guessing the time complexity is O(nlog(n))

Thus, the time complexity should be worse than my previous solutions.

However, the runtime is vastly faster.... Need Check!
