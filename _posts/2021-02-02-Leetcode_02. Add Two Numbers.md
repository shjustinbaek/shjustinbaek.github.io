## Problem Definition

https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

 > You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
 >
 > You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Example 1:**
 >
 > ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)
 >
 > ```
 > Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
 > Output: [7,0,8]
 > Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 2:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
 > Output: [0]
 > ```
 >
 > **Example 3:**
 >
 > ```
 > Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
 > Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 > ```
 >
 >  
 >
 > **Constraints:**
 >
 > - The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
 > - `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
 > - It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Initial Solution : $$O(n)$$

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

def node_to_int(node):
    rtn = 0
    scale = 1
    while node:
        rtn += node.val * scale
        scale *= 10
        node = node.next
    return rtn

def int_to_node(num):
    num = str(num)
    length = len(num)
    
    rtn = ListNode(int(num[-1]))
    node = rtn
    idx = -2
    while idx >= -1*length:
        node.next = ListNode(int(num[idx]))
        node = node.next
        idx -= 1
    return rtn


class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        n1 = node_to_int(l1)
        n2 = node_to_int(l2)
        
        res = n1 + n2
        return int_to_node(res)
```

Making 2 functions that can convert between LinkedList and int, then the problem becomes trivial.
